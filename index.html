	<p>In this work we primarily address the problem of performing accurate bounding box estimation for generic visual tracking. We train a target estimation module offline, conditioned on the target appearance, to predict the overlap between the object and a bounding box estimate. Furthermore, we propose a target classification component that is learned online using dedicated optimization techniques.</p>

	<p>In this work we tackle the key causes behind the problems of computational complexity <i>and</i> over-fitting in advanced DCF trackers.</p>
